fuller stack tests
cache:
  more testing
  path-aware caching (different strategy for manifests, hashes, blobs)
SIS:
  maybe hashes should be in a blob header?
make sure it works well to be mounted and to call store at the same time
  (cache state issues? don't update read cache on writes?)
features:
  gc
  make rename safer
  url sharing export
  set ulimit -n automatically
  support multi-command sessions
    shell?
backends:
  fix s3 to stream directly instead of staging
    in ram. either mitchellh/goamz or uploader type
other TODOs in comments

upload pipeline rewrite:
  stage blob prior to uploading
    fixes
      hashing/file change problems
      open filehandle problems
      s3 concurrent uploading
  breadth-first filepath.Walk (instead of sorting
    internally)
  store metadata in blobs also
    should there be metadata just at the beginning of the blob
    of what blocks are contained or at the beginning of each
    block? easier to compress if it's all at the beginning,
    complicates blob creation and offset calculation
  within-blob block header:
    block hash, path, offset within path, length
    metadata?
  hashes per block, block-level dedupe
  compression per block?
  versioned blob reference (for blob migration)

post rewrite:
  block-level caching?
