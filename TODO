other TODOs in comments

upload pipeline rewrite:
  stage blob prior to uploading
    fixes
      hashing/file change problems
      open filehandle problems
      s3 concurrent uploading
  breadth-first filepath.Walk (instead of sorting
    internally)
  store metadata in blobs also
    should there be metadata just at the beginning of the blob
    of what blocks are contained or at the beginning of each
    block? easier to compress if it's all at the beginning,
    complicates blob creation and offset calculation
  within-blob block header:
    block hash, path, offset within path, length
    metadata?
  hashes per block, block-level dedupe
  compression per block? compression by file extension?
  versioned blob reference (for blob migration)

post rewrite:
  block-level caching?
